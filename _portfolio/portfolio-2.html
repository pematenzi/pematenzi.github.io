This was a project that I did at ReDi School analysing the movie dataset. The project is done using Python. The different libraries that I used for this project are pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy

The project can be found here <a href="https://github.com/pematenzi/class/blob/main/Movie_Data_Analysis.ipynb">Github</a>
